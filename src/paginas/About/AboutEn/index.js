                    <h3>Out of curiosity</h3>
                    <p>I am an active Pokemon Go player, not just me, my 6 year old son has been playing with me for 2 years and we enjoy walking to catch Pokemones. Because of Covid, we started using the PVP section and I was fascinated to see how there are pokemons with such rapid attacks. That’s where my curiosity to understand the whole PVP process was born, and from that curiosity came the idea of making this App.</p>

                    <h3>New experiences</h3>
                    <p>I owe Covid more than one thing. I have felt the need to reinvent myself as a person and relocate myself in the job market. Since 2020, I decided to become a web developer, and this app is perfect to add to my sample portfolio.</p>

                    <h3>Original performance</h3>
                    <p>I’ve seen several APIs and support websites for Pokemon Go players, however, none of them tell how long the charged attacks are loaded. Maybe I didn’t look hard enough, but I decided to do it myself. I plan to slightly increase the performance of this App. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any ideas, or if you wish to collaborate in the development of this App. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
